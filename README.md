Alternatively, put this `index.html` file anywhere then set that location as your browser's startup/new tab page.

In iOS Safari, navigate to one of the above mirrors and `"Add to Favorites"`. Now, a _Google Minus_ app icon will appear on your New Tab screen. Tap that to search instead of the address bar.

In just 10 lines of JavaScript you can go back to a time when Google was actually good. A time before 2 cancerous websites existed: Reddit and Quora.

Enjoy a better the world without these 2 sites.
